# fsPurge

> A powerful multi purpose cleaning and scanning tool for mac

fsPurge is a tool designed to help users completely remove applications and their associated files from mac systems. fsPurge performs deep system scans to identify and remove all traces of an application, including preferences, caches, and hidden files.

## üåü Features

### üîç Intelligent Scanning
- **Deep System Analysis**: Recursively scans multiple system locations for application-related files
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses multiple different pattern matching to find related files
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically bypasses system-critical files and directories as well as ones set by user in config
- **Resource-Efficient**: Has memory optimization and caching for increased performance while scanning

### üßπ Multiple Uninstall Options

#### Standard Uninstall
- Safely uninstalles applications and associated files
- Has detailed progress and confirmation before removals

#### Quick Uninstall
- Targets the original .app bundle and common extra locations
- Has faster speeds than the forced and standard uninstall

#### Force Uninstall
- Uses root level to remove hard to delete apps
- Kills all running processes by itself at the highest level
- Gets through file locks and deals with permissions
- Also does high level system cleanup afterwards

### üìä System Impact Analysis
- **Process Monitoring**: Scans and identifies running apps and background daemons
- **Resource Usage**: Monitors memory and CPU usage
- **Disk Space**: Indicates all disk space used
- **Dependencies**: Finds application dependencies and frameworks used/needed
- **Launch Agents**: Finds startup items easily

### üíæ Backup and Restore
- **Restore Points**: Creates a time snap and allows user to revert back to it in case of issues.
- **Compressed Storage**: Compresses backup to save more storage
- **Metadata Tracking**: Has a lot of info on the back ups

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- App will need root privileges at certain times if needed, it will tell you why and what its doing
- Always recomended to create restore points on at least first run
- Do not start with force uninstall as it is slower and is at a higher privilege.
- All important files are protected by default unless stated by user.
- App is in alpha so feedback and ideas are appreciated.
