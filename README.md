### üßπ Multiple Uninstall Options

#### Standard Uninstall

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- App will need root privileges at certain times if needed, it will tell you why and what its doing
- Always recomended to create restore points on at least first run
- Do not start with force uninstall as it is slower and is at a higher privilege.
- All important files are protected by default unless stated by user.
- App is in alpha so feedback and ideas are appreciated.
